#Scrimba Restaurant Ordering App

This is the solo project from Module 5. Skills demonstrated include data attributes to find event listeners, basic form validation, and dynamic modal display. For the HTML/CSS I mostly followed the design spec as closely as possible, but I did tweak the menu to be vegetarian. :)
